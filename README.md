# tensorflow-cpu-to-gpu
in order to promote the ability when run the tensorflow, i upgrade cpuâ€”vision to gpu-vision.the only thing that should be attention is that the vision of cuda cudnn and tensorflow must be matching, i advice you use the cuda_8 cudnn_6 tensorflow_1.3. sure, the vc++2015 should be exsit before that.
then if you GPU is not great, never try to use the lastest vision library, such as tensorflow.if you don't ignore my advices, the bug may visit you.
